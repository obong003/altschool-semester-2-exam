This is a documentation on how to deploy LAMP stack using ansible on a remote server.
## Process
> I first build the script. Check out the $myscript.sh for detailed instructions.
> next was to install the ansible and create an ansibl.cfg in the ansible folder. 
> next step was to develop my ssh keys from the master node to be able to connect with the slave node securely.
> after writing the playbook and inventory files, I pinged to confirm they're going through.
